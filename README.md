# Guess-my-number

In this project I have mainly focused in Javascript fundamentals, DOM Manipulation, Event Listener, logics and Refactoring.

Game Concept:

The game concept is to guess the secret number in least attempt. The score reduces in (1's) everytime you misguessed. The correct guess in least attempts will added to the High Score. Click Again for the next secret Number.

Game Hint:

If your number is too lower than the secret Number, 'Too Low' message will display. If your number is too higher than the secret Number, 'Too High' message will display. If your number is too closer to the secret Number, 'Too close' message will display.

Thats it..! Have Fun..!
